### Upcoming Sports Stars application makes use of the following software:

Polygon, Matic Network: the network I deployed the app.

Covalent API for a quick way to fetch and retrieve NFTs from a wallet address.
​​
NFTPort for multi-chain NFT minting, and data transparency such as distributing rewards and minting the NFT.

NFTStorage: the data is stored on NFTStorage IPFS, the generated hash (CID) will be used to view the details and to retrieve the NFT.

Solidity: Solidity was used for the smart contract together with OpenZeppelin ERC721 for faster development of the smart contract

Ganache: for local blockchain development

Frontend: React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
